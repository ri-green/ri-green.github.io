                <p class="work-sans-light">The purpose of this page is to provide all the information you might need if you want to try commuting to Maynard without a car. You will find maps of safe biking trails, separate from car traffic, that can form an easy, low-stress route to downtown Maynard with the help of the Fitchburg Commuter Rail line. You will also find resources about how to bring a bicycle on the train and which stations make boarding with a bicycle very simple.

                <br><br> 
                The Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line starts at Boston’s North Station and runs west to Wachusett. Trains leave most stations approximately once per hour for trains towards South Acton in the morning and away from South Acton in the evening.

                <br>
                <h2>MBTA Rules</h2>
                <p>Folding bikes and scooters are always allowed on Commuter Rail Trains. 
                    <br><br>
                    Full-size bicycles are only allowed in the “reverse-commute” direction. You can bring a full-size bike aboard in the morning if you start closer to Boston riding outbound, and you can bring it back in the evening. 
                </p>
                <h2>Where to Store Your Bike <img src="images/bike.png" width="5%"></h2>
                    <p>Most train cars on the Fitchburg line have space to fit at least one full-size bicycle, and the conductors will direct you to other cars on the rare occasion that there are already too many bikes on board. 
                        <br><br>
                        For full-size bicycles, carrying a bungie cord or elastic ski strap is strongly recommended. You can attach the frame of your bike to a handle or luggage rack to keep it upright.
                        <br><br>
                        Early fall is when there are the most cyclists on board between North Station and Brandeis/Roberts. This is when Brandeis University is in session but the weather is still pleasant. If you board the train before it reaches Brandeis/Roberts, be prepared to help other cyclists rearrange bikes as people disembark. 
                    </p>
                <h2>Elevated and Non-Elevated Platforms</h2>
                <p>
                    Elevated platforms provide the easiest way to board the train, as you can simply roll your bicycle on or off. At non-elevated platforms, you must carry your bicycle up or down narrow and steep stairs to enter or exit the train. This can be difficult with full-size bicycles, particularly those with wide handlebars. 
                    <br><br>
                    Stations with elevated platforms are marked as accessible on MBTA timetables.

                <br>
                <img src="images/southacton.jpg" width="70%">
                <p>South Acton station has an elevated boarding platform. There is a pedestrian bridge that crosses between the inbound and outbound platforms with elevators large enough for a full-size bicycle.

                    <br><br>
                <p>Downtown Maynard has a direct connection to South Acton Station on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail line via a dedicated biking and walking path, the Assabet River Rail Trail. This path is separate from car traffic and is relatively flat. If you bike at a relaxed pace to avoid sweating, you can travel between the Mill and Main office complex and South Acton station in under fifteen minutes.
