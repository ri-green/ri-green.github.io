            <p>If you’re like I was three years ago, commuting to Maynard without a car may not  seem possible, let alone pleasant. However, once you learn which bike trails can connect you to the Fitchburg Commuter Rail line, you can trade the time you spend sitting in traffic on Route 2 for some light exercise on your bike and a relaxed ride on the train. 
            </p>
            <p>The goal of this page is to catalog the resources you might need if you want to try traveling to Maynard using both the commuter rail and a bicycle. The bicycle routes listed on this page connect to downtown Maynard and to many of the train stations along the Fitchburg Line. <span class="bold"><em>I have only listed routes that you can ride safely at any speed with little to no interaction with car traffic.</em></span> </p>
            <p>On this page you will find general information about the Fitchburg line, the trail connecting Maynard to South Acton Station, and many other stations along the Fitchburg line that connect to safe bike routes.

            <h1>Connections to Downtown Maynard <img src="images/trail3.png" width="25%"></h1>
                <p>Downtown Maynard has a direct connection to South Acton Station on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail line via a dedicated biking and walking path, the Assabet River Rail Trail. This path is separate from car traffic and is relatively flat. You can travel between the Mill and Main office complex and South Acton station in under fifteen minutes, even if you bike at a relaxed pace to avoid sweating. 
                </p>    
                <h2>South Acton Station</h2>
                    <p>South Acton station has elevated boarding platforms. There is a pedestrian bridge that crosses between the inbound and outbound platforms connected by elevators and stairs. The bridge and the elevators are all large enough for a full-size bicycle.     
                    </p>

                The Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line starts at Boston’s North Station and runs west to Wachusett.  In the morning, trains towards South Acton depart most stations approximately once per hour. Likewise in the evening, trains away from South Acton leave most stations once per hour.

                    <h2>How do you buy commuter rail tickets?</h2>
                        <p>There are multiple ways to pay for a commuter rail ticket:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pay the conductor onboard using cash or card.</li>
                                <li>Use the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/mbta-endorsed-apps" target="_blank" class="bold">MBTA mTicket</a> app for iOS or Android to buy a ticket in advance, then activate it for the conductor. </li>
                                <li>Pay at a subway station vending machine before boarding. </li>
                            </ul>
                    <h2>What are the rules for bringing bikes on the commuter rail?</h2>
                        <p>Folding bikes and compact scooters are always allowed on Commuter Rail Trains. </p>
                        <p>Full-size bicycles are only allowed in the “reverse-commute” direction. You can bring a full-size bike onto the train in the morning if you start closer to Boston and take the train outbound. In the evening, you can bring your bicycle onto the train again for the journey back towards Boston.</p>
                        <p>Full-size bicycles are not allowed on rush-hour trains going towards Boston in the morning or away from Boston in the evening. Timetables on the MBTA website display whether bicycles are allowed on each train.</p>
                            <img src="images/timetable.png" width="75%" class="border">
                                <p class="caption"><em>A timetable on the MBTA website. In the Inbound direction, the 406 train does not allow full-size bicycles, but the 408 train does. </em></p>
                    <h2>Where should I store my bike on the train? </h2>
                        <p>Most train cars on the Fitchburg line have space to fit at least one full-size bicycle near each entrance. On the rare occasion that there are already too many bikes in your train car, the train conductors will direct you to another car where more space is available.</p>
                        <p>If you are bringing a full-size bicycle onto a train, I strongly recommend that you bring a bungie cord or an elastic ski strap with you. You can attach one end of the strap to the frame of your bike and attach the other end to a handle or luggage rack inside the train car. This will keep the bike upright while the train is in motion.</p>

                    <h2>How difficult is it to carry a bike onto the train?</h2>
                        <p>It all depends on the station where you board or disembark.</p>
                        <p>Elevated platforms provide the easiest way to board the train, as you can simply roll your bicycle from the platform onto the train car. </p>
                        <p>At non-elevated platforms, you must carry your bicycle up or down steep and narrow stairs between the platform and train car. This can be difficult with a full-size bicycle. If you plan to board or disembark at a station with non-elevated platforms, make sure you are comfortable carrying your bike and bags up and down stairs.</p>
                        <p>Stations with elevated platforms are marked as <em>accessible</em> on MBTA timetables. In the following sections, I list whether elevated platforms are available at each station.</p>

                    <h2>When are the most cyclists riding the train?</h2>
                        <p>You can expect to find other cyclists using the train most often during late spring and early fall, when Brandeis University is in session. The Fitchburg line can be particularly busy traveling from North Station to Brandeis/Roberts in the morning. </p>
                        <p>If you ever need to lean your bike up against other bikes, be ready to move it out of the way when someone else needs to access their bicycle and disembark. </p>
