    <div id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Top rope (“TR”) soloing is an advanced style of climbing in which a climber uses ascending devices on a fixed rope to climb a pitch without the need for a belayer to manage slack. There are many tried-and-true systems that work for TR soloing, but many are lacking in terms of convenience or safety. Most require a complex transition into lowering mode, which can be frustrating and open up opportunities for error. Some use a single device with no back-up should the device fail. In this guide, you will learn how to use the <a href="https://taz3d.fr/product/lov3/?lang=en" target="_blank">TAZ LOV3</a> as your main ascender and descender with a <a href="https://www.petzl.com/US/en/sport/pulleys/micro-traxion" target="_blank">Petzl Micro Traxion</a> as a back-up. This set-up makes climbing and lowering a breeze, and the convenient back-up device and lack of a complex transition into lowering mode make it safer than many others out there.
            <br>
                <p class="emphasis center-text">Neither the LOV3 nor the Micro Traxion were designed for use in top rope soloing.

    <div id="why-taz">
        <h3>Why the TAZ LOV3?</h3>
        <p>The TAZ LOV3 is a non-toothed fall arrest device and descender designed for people who work-at-height. When used for TR soloing, it provides reliable, immediate catches and allows you to lower quickly and easily without the need for managing your own slack, or a complex transition into lowering mode. This minimizes opportunities for error and is great for projecting routes. The LOV3 is unfortunately quite expensive, but currently one of very few devices that also functions as a descender (the main alternatives being Rock Exotica’s more expensive <a href="https://www.rockexotica.com/products/unicender" target="_blank">Unicender</a>, or the Gri Gri, which requires you to manage your own slack).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="why-mt">
        <h3>Why the Petzl Micro Traxion?</h3>
        <p>The Petzl Micro Traxion (“MT”) is a compact, lightweight, toothed progress capture device. As a back-up to the LOV3, it is non-intrusive, reliable, and easy to disengage for a quick transition into lowering mode. This makes it a great choice for those hesitant to use a back-up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="why-backup">
        <h3>Why Use a Back-Up Device?</h3>
        <p>Although many people TR solo with a single device and live to tell the tale, the reality is, without a back-up, a single error or device malfunction can lead to serious injury, or even death. The slight inconvenience of a back-up device is a small price to pay for something that may very likely save your life one day.

        <h3>Weight the Rope</h3>
            <p>Adding some weight to the end of your rope keeps the rope taught and allows it to feed smoothly through your devices. 
            To weight your rope: 
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tie a clove hitch to a carabiner beneath your devices.</li>
                    <li>Clip on only as much weight as you find allows your rope to feed smoothly. 
                        <br><i>A full 32oz Nalgene water bottle and a pair of shoes, or a bag filled with some gear from your pack should do the trick.</i></li>
                    <li>Adjust the height of the knot as necessary so that the load does not touch the ground when the rope is weighted.</li>

                <h3>Tab on the MT</h3>
                    <p>The MT has a small tab on the locking mechanism that can cause it to lock open while climbing (see below). This disengages progress capture mode and prevents the device from catching you if you fall and your primary device fails. Some people file this tab off to prevent this issue. If you choose not to do this, be sure to check the MT periodically while climbing to ensure that it is still in progress capture mode.</p>

                <h3>Plastic Cleat on the TAZ LOV3</h3>
                    <p>The TAZ LOV3 has a plastic cleat that is involved in initiating the locking mechanism. On rare occasions this cleat can get stuck, preventing the device from stopping a fall as quickly (or at all). Some people file this cleat slightly to prevent this.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This issue has been eliminated in the newer version of the LOV3. To test which version you have, push the plastic cleat upwards (as shown below) and see if you can get it to stick in the open position. If you cannot get it to stick, you likely have the newer version, so this may be less of a concern.
