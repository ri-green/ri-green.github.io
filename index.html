    <div id="intro" class="mainbody">
        <p>Top rope (“TR”) soloing is an advanced style of climbing in which a climber uses ascending devices on a fixed rope to climb a pitch without the need for a belayer to manage slack. There are many tried-and-true systems that will allow you to top rope solo safely. In this guide, you will learn how to use the TAZ LOV3 as your main ascender and descender with a Petzl Micro Traxion as a back-up.

     <h2>Warning! This is advanced stuff.</h2>

    <div class="warning-text">
        TR soloing is dangerous and should only be attempted by advanced climbers with a strong background in roped climbing and self-rescue.
        <br><br>
        Unanticipated user error and mechanical failures beyond the scope of this guide are likely and can result in serious injury or death.
        <br><br>
        Consult a guide or other authorized instructor before attempting.

    <div id="why-taz" class="mainbody">
    <h3>Why the TAZ LOV3?</h3>

    <p>The TAZ LOV3 is a non-toothed fall arrest device and descender designed for people who work-at-height.  When used for TR soloing, it provides reliable, immediate catches and allows you to lower quickly and easily without the need for managing your own slack, or a complicated transition into rappel mode. This minimizes opportunities for error, and is great for projecting routes. The device is unfortunately quite expensive, but currently one of very few devices that also function as a descender (the other main alternatives being Rock Exotica’s more expensive <a href="https://www.rockexotica.com/products/unicender" target="_blank">Unicender</a>, or the Gri Gri, which requires you to manage your own slack).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="why-mt" class="mainbody">
    <h3>Why the Petzl Micro Traxion?</h3>

    <p>The Petzl Micro Traxion (“MT”) is a compact, lightweight, toothed progress capture device. As a back-up to the LOV3, it is non-intrusive, reliable, and easy to disengage for a quick transition into rappel mode, making it a great choice for those hesitant to use a back-up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="why-backup" class="mainbody">
    <h3>Why use a back-up device?</h3>

    <p>Although many people TR solo with a single device and live to tell the tale, the reality is, without a back-up, a single error or device malfunction can lead to serious injury, or even death. The slight inconvenience of a back-up device is a small price to pay for something that may very likely save your life one day.

    <h3>Weight the Rope</h3>

    Adding some weight to the end of your rope keeps the rope taught and allows it to feed smoothly through your devices. To weight your rope, tie a clove hitch to a carabiner beneath your devices. Make sure the knot is high enough to prevent the load from touching the ground when the rope is weighted. Add only as much weight as you find allows your rope to feed smoothly. A full 32oz Nalgene water bottle, a pair of shoes, or a canvas bag filled with some gear from your pack should do the trick.

    <div id="to-rope" class="mainbody">
    <h3>Connect the devices to the rope</h3>
    Press the button on the LOV3 to open the device. Insert your rope into device as shown below and close device fully. Connect LOV3 to locking carabiner to lock device closed. Ensure that bungee cord is attached to the carabiner on each side of device, and carabiner is locked.

    Attach a small locking carabiner to each end of an 11cm dogbone. Open the Micro Traxion and insert rope as show below. Close the device and connect to locking carabiner on one end of the dogbone. Ensure carabiner is locked

    <h3>Connect the devices to your harness</h3>

    Attach both devices to the belay loop on your harness with the LOV3 positioned above the MT. Ensure carabiners are locked.

    <div id="taught" class="mainbody">
    <h3>Keep the LOV3 taught</h3>
    If the LOV3 and MT collide, they may malfunction and fail to arrest your fall. To prevent this, it is important to keep the LOV3 taught above the MT.

    Take length of bungee cord and tie a small overhand loop on each end. The cord must be long enough to wear it around the back of your neck when attached to the LOV3’s carabiner, but short enough to keep the LOV3’s carabiner upright and the device taught near your stomach. Slide the loops onto the LOV3’s carabiner, with the LOV3 seated between them.

    <div id="descend" class="mainbody">
    <h3>Descending with the LOV3</h3>
    To descend, ensure that you are in a hanging position with your weight fully supported by the LOV3. Simply disengage the MT, and use the LOV3’s handle to descend.

    Note: Some find the handle on the LOV3 difficult to maneuver at first. Err on the side of caution when getting the hang of it, as pulling the handle too far too fast can lead to abrupt, rapid descents. To stop a rapid descent, simply release your hand from the handle.

    <div id="fail-modes" class="mainbody">
    <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
    There are several documented ways in which these devices can fail to catch your fall. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Always tie at least one catastrophe knot to prevent a ground fall in the event of an unexpected device failure. 

    <h3>Keep your devices separate.</h3>
    If your devices collide, it can prevent them from functioning normally. The purpose of the bungee cord and the dogbone is to prevent this. Make sure that your devices stay separated at all times. 

    <h3 id="mt-fail">Tab on the MT</h3>
    [PHOTO]
    The MT has a small tab on the locking mechanism that can cause it to become locked open while climbing. This disengages the device from progress-capture mode and prevents it from catching you if you fall and your primary device fails. Some people file this nub off to prevent this issue. Whatever you choose to do, be sure to check the MT occasionally to ensure that it is still engaged while climbing. 
        <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53538373826_09a57d4bb0.jpg">
    <h3>Plastic Cleat on the TAZ LOV3</h3>
    [PHOTO]
    The older version of the TAZ LOV3 has a plastic cleat that is involved in initiating the locking mechanism. On rare occasions this tab can get stuck open, preventing the device from stopping a fall as quickly (or at all). Some people file this tab slightly to prevent this. 
    <br><br>
    This issue has been eliminated in the newer LOV3. To test which version you have, push the plastic cleat on your device into the open position and see if you can get it to stick. If you cannot get it to stick, you likely have the newer version, so this will be less of a concern.

    <h2>Additional Warnings and considerations</h2>
    <ul class="bullet">
    <li>Long hair, loose clothes, slings and other dangling accessories can get sucked into devices and prevent them from catching you. Keep long hair tied back and completely out of the way (even a long ponytail can get caught) and wear a fitted top with no dangling accessories that could get caught in your devices.  
        </li>
        <br>
    <li>After you leave the ground, and any time you climb past any ledges, it is a good idea to tie a catastrophe knot in your rope. A one-handed slip knot works great for this.
        </li>
        <br>
    <li>As always, be considerate of other climbers and share the crag. 
        </li>

    <h2>Recommended Gear</h2>
    Grivel Clepsydra S K10GS
    Compact and lightweight. Twin-gate design ensures that carabiner will never come unlocked while climbing.    Isolate the belay loop behind a wire gate, keeping the devices in the proper orientation and preventing crossloading.)
