                Are you curious about craft chocolate but don't know where to start? Here are answers to some common questions to help you make sense of the writing on the package and get started on your own craft chocolate journey.

            <h1>What is craft chocolate?</h1>

                <p class="def">

                Craft chocolate is chocolate that is made on a <strong>small scale</strong>, often <strong>by hand or in small batches</strong>.

                </p>

                <p>

                The term is used to distinguish chocolate made in this way from commercial, industrial, or mass-produced chocolate, which is chocolate that has been produced by large companies on a larger scale using industrial machinery. Craft chocolate makers prioritize flavor over volume, and value using high-quality ingredients sourced from ethical producers. They work on the cutting edge of the chocolate industry to demonstrate the possibilities of chocolate and sustainable production.

            <h1>What does <em>bean-to-bar</em> mean?</h1>

            <img src="images/beantobar.png" width="40%" class="center" alt="">

            <br>

                <p class="def">

                <b><em>Bean-to-bar</em></b> chocolate is chocolate that is made starting with <strong>cocoa beans</strong> instead of a pre-processed product like cocoa powder or chocolate liquor. 

                </p>

                <p>

                Bean-to-bar makers handle each step of the production process on their own, from roasting the beans to molding the finished product. This gives them fuller control over the flavor profile in the finished chocolate.

                </p>

        </div>

        <br>

        <div>

            <h1>What does <em>single-origin</em> mean?</h1>

                <p class="def">

                <b><em>Single-origin</em></b> means that the bar was made with beans from <strong>a single farm</strong> instead of a blend of beans from multiple farms.

                </p>

                <p>

                Craft chocolate enthusiasts value single-origin chocolate because it allows you to taste the unique qualities of a specific cocoa bean. 

                </p>

        </div>

        <br>

        <div>

            <h1>What does the percentage on the package mean?</h1>

                <p class="def">The percentage on the package refers to <strong>how much of the bar is made from cocoa beans</strong>.

                </p>

                <p>

                A bar of 70% dark chocolate is <strong><em>70% cocoa beans</em></strong> and 30% other ingredients, like sugar and cocoa butter. 

                </p>

        </div>

        <br>

        <div>

            <h1>Why is it so expensive?</h1>

            <p class="def">

                Craft chocolate costs more because it is generally <strong>more expensive to produce</strong> than commercial chocolate.

            </p>

            <p>

            Craft chocolate makers invest a great deal of time and money into sourcing ingredients that are higher in quality and more ethically produced than the ingredients commonly used in commercial chocolate. They prioritize paying farmers a fair wage and ensuring that their beans are grown and processed in a way that brings out the best possible flavors. 

            </p>

            <p>

            Add to this the increased labor costs of making chocolate by hand in small batches, and you wind up with prices that are higher than many are used to. 

            </p>

            <p>

            The sticker shock is understandable, but that high cost goes toward ensuring the highest-quality chocolate and that all people involved in its production are treated fairly.

            </p>

        <br>

        <div>

            <h1>Why is ethical sourcing important?</h1>

            <p class="def">

                Sourcing ingredients from ethical producers <strong>rejects and discourages harmful practices</strong> that are common on cocoa plantations.

            </p>

By partnering with ethical farms and paying farmers a fair wage, craft chocolate makers are playing a small role in the shift toward a more ethical future for chocolate.

            A bar of craft chocolate’s flavor profile is primarily related to several factors: <strong><a href="https://barandcocoa.com/pages/varieties-of-cocoa-beans" target="_blank">bean variety</a></strong>, <strong>growing environment</strong>, <strong><a href="https://source.colostate.edu/chocolates-secret-ingredient-is-the-fermenting-microbes-that-make-it-taste-so-good/" target="_blank">fermentation</a> method</strong>, <strong><a href="https://chocolatealchemy.com/cocoa-bean-roasting" target="_blank">roasting</a> technique</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://thechocolatelife.com/ama-ask-me-anything-about-cocoa-or-chocolate-8-what-is-conching/" target="_blank">conching</a> duration</strong>.

            <p>

                <ul>

                    <li>The cocoa bean’s <strong>genetics</strong> and <strong>growing environment</strong> dictate the amounts of <strong>chemicals responsible for flavor and aroma</strong> that will be present in the beans upon harvest.

                    </li>

                    <li>After harvest, cocoa beans are <strong>fermented</strong>. This <strong>develops their flavor and acidity</strong>, but the beans still taste nothing like chocolate at this stage.

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Roasting</strong> and <strong>conching</strong> (grinding and mixing the beans for long periods in special machines) causes the beans to develop their familiar chocolatey flavor.

                         <ul class="indent">

                            <li>These processes introduce <strong>heat</strong> and <strong>airflow</strong>, allowing makers to <strong>eliminate unpleasant flavors and aromas</strong>, and <strong>highlight desirable ones</strong>. 

                            </li>

                            <li>In the hands of a skilled maker, this careful process can result in a <strong>complex and nuanced flavor profile</strong>.
